FAQ<br/>
Q. What are chocos and how to use?<br/>
A. you get chocos for killing npcs and players and you can find them on the island, all your money will be multiplied by your chocos!<br/>
<br/>
Q. Where can I get a gun?<br/>
A. Weapons are found in one of three places, first in ammo caches that randomly spawn around the map inside and outside buildings, and second, in the gear section of the vehicles, which also randomly spawn around the map. The last place to find a gun would be at the weapons at the ParaStore. You can also find them on dead players whose bodies have not yet been looted.
<br/><br/>
Q. What are the Parastore?<br/>
A. it is an Powerfull Tool where you can buy vehicles, chopper, planes, jets, tanks ,ships, weapons, utility, nightvision googles, objects and buildings and our funny Expensives<br/>

<br/><br/>
Q. Is it ok for me to shoot my team mates?<br/>
A. If you are member of BLUFOR or OPFOR teams, then you are not allowed to shoot or steam items and vehicles from other players. If you play as Independent, you are free to engage anyone as well as team up with anyone you want.
<br/><br/>
Q. Whats with the teapots and big bags?<br/>
A. This game has a food and water system that you must stay on top of if you hope to survive. You can collect food and water from water barrels, food stands, or dead players bodies. Food and water will randomly spawn around the map. Other items that will randomly spawn are fuel cans for refueling vehicles, medkits for healing yourself, and repair kits for repairing vehicles. Each of these is a one-time-only use item.
<br/><br/>
